                        This is the documentation site for Tori Bornino,
                        Jackson Mclaughlin, and Zachary Stednitz's code used in
                        ME 405 - Mechatronics, Lab 4: Interrupt Service Routine,
                        taught in Winter 2022 by Dr. John
                        Ridgely. Source code is available at:

    @section sec_sch    Task Scheduler in Main
                        We were supplied with cotask.py, task_share.py, and
                        print_task.py to implement
                        a scheduler to run our step response. The ISR was 
                        implemented in @ref main "main" and was used to read
                        from the ADC.
